## WiFI
- Always use as few SSIDs as possible, as they consume quite a bit of airtime(overhead)
- Block all outbound ports except common ones: 21, 22, 23, proxy 53 to dns filter, proxy 80, 443
- Don't forget to deny inter-user bridging (Aruba-speak for stopping devices talking to other devices on the vlan)
- Guests gets full access to the internet but primary network has full priority
- Guests recieves a temporary ticket for using WiFI which expierces in X hours / days / weeks
- Individual guest clients may even be isolated from each other
- Isolated from the primary network
- Seperate SSID and VLAN (Guest WiFI / Coperated WiFi)
- Traffic shaping, QoS, and blocking outbound tcp/25 are appropriate measures for the guest uplink
- Web filtering and preventing most "bad" wesbites
- Wireless devices get there own VLAN / WLAN and you can configure the DHCP lease time to less then an hour.
