* Use a print server where all printers are installed and you have control over all printer drivers
* Use AD groups and GPP to give the users the printers they need and set them up as default printers
* Use DHCP reservation (with the MAC address) instead of static
* Use the print server for the print spooler (performance) and not on the clients
