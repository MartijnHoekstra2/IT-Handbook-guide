#### Room information
- There may be no water sources above the server room. E.g. sinks / toilets, water pipes. 
- Depending on your location you need to make sure the server room is above sea level so there is no risk of a flood.
- Completely separate eletrical circuits to the rest of the building.

#### Uninterruptible Power Supply
- Calculator for UPS, for example: http://www.apc.com/tools/ups_selector/index.cfm

Bench with abundant power, if you don't already have an area for this.
Safe for high security material and on-site backup media.
Digital multimeter, if anyone can be expected to know how to use it.
Every so often a temperature-controlled soldering station can be a life saver, again, if someone knows how to use it.
Heat gun if you use heat-shrink tubing.

Industrial wire shelving and bins


Multimeter

Backup cooling. If a fully redundant cooling unit is beyond your budget, a "dalek", or even a high-powered fan and venting duct is better than nothing. You could also look at buying store credit at a local rental place - don't rely on management to keep money set aside.
Wall loading. It's never fun when a loaded wall-mount rack rips itself off the wall because some fool mounted it onto the drywall, or onto those weak-ass aluminium studs.
Floor loading. Make sure your floor can take the weight, including in the hall you're moving the kit through.
Service contracts. ACs and UPSs need regular maintenance, don't neglect it!
TOIL or overtime agreements. Make sure you get reimbursed for any out-of-hours migration work.


Water, smoke and temperature sensing.
Personally I'd recommend a floor rack rather wall mount. If you DO go wall mount, I always preferred a giant sheet of plywood. My last gig, it was on a block wall so when I was done, you could probably have mounted a motorcycle by the time you were done. Personally, I paint it before or after mounting. Makes it much easier to mount later stuff and is less messy, but I'm quirky on neat cabling and mounting when humanly possible.
Two power poles. One to UPS, other to normal power or ideally second UPS. If not a second UPS, good sacrificial surge protector. Make sure it is on its own breaker. Ideally, get a dedicated panel for the room. Makes life easier if you can swing a generator. If not a permanent installed generator, make the provisions for a cutover to route your dedicated panel to a generator without backfeeding. That would be very bad. Not ueber expensive, most of those have been $600-$1500 depending on the circumstances.
Lockable door. I swung for combo locks with an audit trail, but a camera or two that you can remotely access would do the job fine.
FLASHLIGHTS. BIG ONES. Buy or make mounts, put them on the walls. Spare batteries.
Place for stores. I just bought cheap clear plastic bins and a label maker. Every bloody thing goes in a plastic bin, bin is labeled and then neatly shelved. Best system I've figured out for storing... well, everything that wasn't hideously expensive, easy to follow and actually helpful.
Take a couple minutes to ponder your fire suppression. If you can't afford a real gas or dry water system, make provisions and get it put in some future budget. If nothing else, make sure the fire extinguishers are electronics safe.
All critical keys on a key ring in a specific location. Something you can grab in seconds.
Sort out your cable management. Overhead wire troughs aren't very expensive and can be managed easily with velcro or zip ties. Small ladder makes life easier.
Small tool box with cheap tools so you're not running around for when you need a specific sized flat head or whatnot.

The rail kits always make me feel like an idiot. I think the best thing to do is lay the server on a bench and figure out how the inserts slide into the rails. Then take it all apart and mount it in the rack.



Everyone here was bad at these tasks until we got good through trial & error.

Everyone here has a story of when they installed some cables, stepped back to look at their work, and decided they HAD to uninstall them, and do it again a second time, a different way.

What type of network cables should I buy, and how many?

Apply your diagnostic & problem solving skills and develop your own answer to this question.

What kind of NIC is in the server?
RJ45 or SFP+ ?
What kind of switch are you connecting to?
Does it have RJ45 ports or SFP+ ports?
How fast do the NIC & switch go?
CAT-5e is certified for up to 1Gbps of capacity.
CAT-6 is certified for 1Gbps out to 100m length, and 10Gbps out to 55m.
CAT-6A is certified for 1Gbps or 10Gbps out to 100m length.
SFP+ Twinax or DAC (Direct Attach Cables) support 10Gbps out to about 15m.
SFP+ Fiber Optic connections can go much longer distances.
How many cables should you buy?
- How many do you need, plus how many spared make you feel confident & comfortable.
- MAKE SURE you are buying the correct cable lengths.

And also - I need SAN cables for the EMC.
What kinds of connectors does your SAN provide?
What kind of connector does the FC HBA in the server provide? (I'll bet it's an LC connector)


Cat6 is your friend. It's cheap to install now, VERY EXPENSIVE to install later. Figure out the maximum amount of Cat6 you think you might ever need, then double that.

At the very least, each area that might possibly someday be used as a desk should have 2 Cat6's.

Consider bundle cable. That's where a few separate wires are bundled together in one fat wire. In a home you'd commonly find 2 Cat6 and 2 coax. However there are lots of choices, maybe 2x Cat6 and 1 run of 50 micron fiber would be good.

Conduit is also your friend, especially if you won't have drop ceilings.

Remember WiFi! Have Cat6 runs (two) to areas in the ceiling where your WiFi APs will go. I recommend Ubiquiti UAP-AC-PRO's (802.11ac centrally managed PoE AP for $150, NOT consumer garbage) but if you want to pay $400/AP for Cisco then have fun. wavvo had a good idea of doing a wireless survey, although I believe in just putting one AP in each room if you don't have a stupid number of rooms.

Cooling and power for your server room depend on what you'll be running there. If it's just a few servers in one rack, an exhaust fan or a Mr. Slim might be all you need. If you'll have several racks worth of stuff, then talk to someone who's familiar with DATACENTER cooling. Long story short, the server cooling system should ideally be separate from the rest of the building, because you're going to have a lot of heat in one room.

You'll also want environmental monitoring equipment in there. While stories like this may be an extreme 'it could happen', you still want to know if/when the AC starts to fail.

Same thing with power- if it's just one or two racks then maybe a few 240v dedicated circuits are all you need, but if it's bigger you'll need more. Consider UPS- if you have more than a couple racks it can make sense to get a larger UPS (think Symmetra).

Fire is another issue. A datacenter bigger than 1-2 racks may need its own fire suppression. You don't want sprinklers for reasons that should be obvious. That means halon type systems.

Also consider physical security. The datacenter should not be accessible with standard 'master keys'- no janitor or night security guard should be able to get into the server room. There is literally no benefit to having such access and lots of potential downsides. If the building is going to have electronic locks (which any good building should), you should be all over the security vendor and carefully integrating their equipment into your network. You (yes YOU, the IT person) should have management access to that system IMHO and it should not be remotely accessible (or at least the part that controls the datacenter shouldn't be).
