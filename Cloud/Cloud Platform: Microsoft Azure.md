### Active Directory Azure configuration information

* Azure Virtual Networks can be configured to use DCs for DNS services

* Place AD database and logs on data disk with NO caching and NOT on OS disk
* Assign a reserved IP address to the DC using Azure Configuration
* Update the Virtual Network DNS to use Azure based DCs first
* Make at least one DC in Azure a Global Catalog
* Create if possible multiple DCs in Azure if one's being maintained
* Configure Azure DCs to NOT publisch generic DNS records
* If placing multiple DCss in Azure deploy them in an Availability Set

### Active Directory Azure configuration information
##### Site Configuration
* In Active Directory Sites and Services configure each Azure region to be its own Active Directory site
* If you're using multiple regions, then make sure that is visible within the name
* Define the IP subnets that are being used for that site, so you have a site to subnet link
* At the Inter-Site Transport configure a site link between a location which is physically connected to Azure. 
##### Database placement
##### IP reservation and network configuration
##### Generic DNS record suppression
