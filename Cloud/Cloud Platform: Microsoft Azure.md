### Active Directory Azure configuration information
* Azure Virtual Networks can be configured to use DCs for DNS services
* Update the Virtual Network DNS to use Azure based DCs first
* Make at least one DC in Azure a Global Catalog
* Create if possible multiple DCs in Azure if one's being maintained
* If placing multiple DCss in Azure deploy them in an Availability Set
* Generally RODC is NOT a good fit for Azure (Apps don't work very well and there is traffic)

##### Site Configuration
* In Active Directory Sites and Services configure each Azure region to be its own Active Directory site
* If you're using multiple regions, then make sure that is visible within the name
* Define the IP subnets that are being used for that site, so you have a site to subnet link
* At the Inter-Site Transport configure a site link between a location which is physically connected to Azure.

##### Database placement within an Azure based domain controller
* Add/Create a new data disk to the Azure based DC with with NO caching NO read NO write (Host Caching: None)
* When running DC Promo configure the NTDS and SYSVOl to be placed on this data disk
* Dont store the NTDS and SYSVOL on the OS drive

##### IP reservation and network configuration
* Assign a reserved IP static address to the DC using Azure Configuration

##### Generic DNS record suppression
* To supress the creation og generic DNS records you can read about this article:
[How to optimize the location of a domain controller or global catalog that resides outside of a client's site](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/306602/how-to-optimize-the-location-of-a-domain-controller-or-global-catalog)

### Enabling Cloud Service Relationships with Federation
* Managing identity
* Provisioning and deprovisioning accounts
* Identifying cloud services used within an organization
* Managing federations
* Reporting and auditing
* Providing a simple user experience
* Account STS / Resources STS (STS stand for Security Token Service)
* Choice of sign-in of WS-Fed, OAuth or SAML, which one to use depends on the application or vendor
* Use a dedicated server for Azure AD Connect if possible
* After configuring Azure AD Connect open the Synchronization Service to configure which OU's to sync. This can be done by going to the Connectors and select the AD and go to Configure Directory Parititions and then Containers
* Running a "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Azure AD Sync\Bin\DirectorySyncClientCmd.exe delta [LearnCompany.LTD]". This will for a synchronization the easiest way between AD and Azure AD.
* Authentication Options below:
1. Authentication Option 1: AD DS > Identity sync with password hash > Microsoft Azure AD
2. Authentication Option 2: AD DS > Identity Sync with ADFS > Micrososft Azure AD < Best option

### Discovery Cloud Applications Used in Your Organization
* Azure AD Cloud App Discovery is a feature of Azure AD premium, and lets you install an agent on devices. It will run in the background and search for services which are users are using. This is based on HTTP or HTTPS, if the application/services does not use HTTP or HTTPS the application won't be discoverd.
* Informing the organization that you are going to collect this information is optional. Can be specific at the donwload part of the agent.
* [Cloud App Discovery System Center Deployment Guide](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30968.cloud-app-discovery-system-center-deployment-guide.aspx)
* [Cloud App Discovery Group Policy Deployment Guide](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30965.cloud-app-discovery-group-policy-deployment-guide.aspx)
* It will create an server on the devices named: Micrososft Cloud App Discovery Endpoint Agent
* Within Azure AD you will get a report about the information which Applications are being used. Do know that there will be noise on this report, since it will report also applications which you have never used. But this application probaly fetches some information which causes to show up in the repot.
* With a filter you can change the ammount of days its showing

### Reports
* [What are Azure Active Directory reports?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/reports-monitoring/overview-reports)

### Storage
* Persistent vs Non-Persistent, most of the time you will choice for persistent
* Persistent: able to write data / power off a system and bring online and the data still is there / move virtual machines between nodes, and its storage is always there.
* Non-Persistent: Think of a temporary disk while rebooting it stays there, but shut it down and then start it again you will lose it.
* Other considerations: Durability. Resiliency, Performances, Connectivity, File- vs Block-based
* [Windows Azure Storage: A Highly Available Cloud Storage Service with Strong Consistency](https://sigops.org/s/conferences/sosp/2011/current/2011-Cascais/printable/11-calder.pdf)

### Azure Storage offerings
* Storage Services available: StorSimple, Azure Backup, Azure SQL Database, content delivery networks and media services.
* Storage Services type: Blobs (in containers as block or page). Blob is also know as object storage), is unstructured object data.
* Storage Services types Tables (which have entities with field:value properties to NoSQL with no fixed schema), is structured data.
* Storage Services type: Queues (which have messages)
* Storage Services type: Files (via SMB shares)
* For infrastructure the big focus is on page blobs

### Azure Regions
* Storage Stamps are deployed to datacenters which live in an Azure Region
* An Azure Region has many datacenters that are wiithin a latency boundary
* There are Azure Regeions throughout the globe and more are added every year 
* Regions are paired for geo-redundant storage replication

### ASM (Azure Service Manager) / ARM ( Azure Resources Manager)
* Focus is on ARM as that is the new model for Azure that has support for RBAC, JSON templates, dependencies, tags. granular bullying and hybrid consistency via Azure Stack
* Cannot mix resources, if you still want that it needs to be through VPNs or Express Route or something else. So this is why use possible ARM for all deployments.
