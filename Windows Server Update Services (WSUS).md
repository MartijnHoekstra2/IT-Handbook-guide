## Windows Server Update Services (WSUS)
 
 #### How to identify and decline superseded updates in WSUS
 * No icon: update doesnâ€™t supersede another one nor is it superseded by an update.
 * Blue square on top: this update supersedes another update, these updates you do not want to clean!
 * Blue square in the middle: this update has been superseded by another update, and superseded another update as well, this is an example of an update you may want to clean (decline).
 * Blue square in the right below corner: this update has been superseded by another update, this is an example of an update you may want to clean (decline)
 
 Note: Always verify that all superseding updates are approved before doing this operation!
